# A script that shows Bangladesh Railway ticket information

## Step:
1. Install all the dependencies by running this command 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
2. Run 'CheckTicket.py' python file and provide the neccessary inputs
3. You are done ! The script should now show you name of the train, departure time and price

### How it works:
Instantiating the class with required arguments gets the data from API and stores it in json formate. 
get_info() method formats and prints it in a nice way.
